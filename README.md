# coordinates-converter-
Repo to represent app(s) for coordinate systems converting. 

First pair for converting: SK-42 to WGS-84 and back.
SK-42 in metres to WHS-84 in angulars. 
All spikes are in Spike folder.

[Conserved] due to uncertain final goal and other priorities.
(a lot of russian web hosts due to specifics of SK-42)
